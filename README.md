# PALETTE

This tool will attempt to analyze a PNG file and pull the most common unique colors to form a palette.

## TODO
 - Accept other file types other than just PNG
 - Customize number of colors to return via argument
 - Give accessibility information of the color palette
 - Show visualization of the palette in the terminal 
 - Create a design-doc style image that compares the input image with the created palette.
